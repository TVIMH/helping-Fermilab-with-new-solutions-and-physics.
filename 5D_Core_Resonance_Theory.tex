\title{Dimensional Harmonic Coupling: A 5D Theory of Solar-Core Resonance}
\author{Alpha AI Research}

\maketitle
\section*{Abstract}
This paper presents a unified 5D-core harmonic resonance theory describing the interaction between solar-magnetospheric events and phase-locked antimatter components in the Earth’s deep interior.
\section{Core Theory}
Earth’s 5D core is a toroidal antimatter resonance stabilized by gravitational and temporal shear harmonics. This zone is sensitive to solar-induced dimensional field drifts.
\section{Model Summary}
We simulate magnetospheric coupling with the inner 5D region under CME, IMF, and Schumann conditions.
